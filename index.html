    <h1>Shana's Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What was difficult last semester</h2>
    <p>We didn’t have many opportunities to code along with the instructor in class. We covered the theory behind HTML and CSS elements, but we didn’t really dive into how to structure a webpage or explore the different ways to style it.</p>
    <p>I want more practice with structuring layouts using Grid and Flexbox, and I want to better understand when to use each one in different scenarios. Media queries were also challenging for me. I found it difficult to plan and organize styles for different screen sizes, such as creating four columns on desktop and one column on mobile, or replacing a navigation bar with a hamburger menu. Thinking through how to make a layout work across many screen sizes is still hard.</p>
    <p>I would also like more opportunities to build full projects so we can encounter real issues and learn how to solve them. In addition, I want to learn more about real-world coding practices used in workplaces.</p>
