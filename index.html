    <h1>Shana's Learning Plan</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>What was difficult last semester?</h2>
        <h3>What happened: Not enough hands‑on coding practice</h3>
        <p>We didn’t have many opportunities to code along with the instructor in class. We covered the theory behind HTML and CSS elements, but we didn’t really dive into how to structure a webpage or explore the different ways to style it.</p>
        <h3>Why it was difficult: Layout and responsive design were confusing</h3>
        <p>I want more practice with structuring layouts using Grid and Flexbox, and I want to better understand when to use each one in different scenarios. Media queries were also challenging for me. I found it difficult to plan and organize styles for different screen sizes, such as creating four columns on desktop and one column on mobile, or replacing a navigation bar with a hamburger menu. Thinking through how to make a layout work across many screen sizes is still hard.</p>
        <h3>What will change: Build full projects and learn real workflow habits</h3>
        <p>I would also like more opportunities to build full projects so we can encounter real issues and learn how to solve them. In addition, I want to learn more about real-world coding practices used in workplaces.</p>

        <h2>My action plan for learning</h2>
        <h3>How I’m Leveling Up My Coding Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Build full mini-projects to reinforce concepts through repetition.</li>
            <li>Practice recreating exisitng websites layouts using Grid or Flexbox.</li>
            <li>Follow a mobile-first approach and create a checklist for responsive design.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Weekly Coding Routine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Code 3 times per week, 45 minutes each session.</li>
            <li>Tools: VS Code, MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, HTML and CSS Validator.</li>
            <li>Checkpoint: At the end of each week, review what I built and write a short reflection and what could be improved.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Layout Practice Using Real Websites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pick one website per week and recreate a section (header, hero, card grid, footer).</li>
            <li>Build it twice: once with Flexbox, once with Grid.</li>
            <li>Compare which method felt more efficient.</li>
            <li>Tools: VS Code, Chrome DevTools, HTML and CSS Validator.</li>
            <li>Checkpoint: Save screenshots and notes in a folder to track progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Responsive Design Practice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a personal checklist: breakpoints, typography scaling, spacing, navigation changes.</li>
            <li>Build one responsive component per week (e.g., card grid, navbar, gallery).</li>
            <li>Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop using DevTools.</li>
            <li>Tools: VS Code, Chrome DevTools device simulator, MDN responsive design guide.</li>
            <li>Checkpoint: By Week 4, complete a small responsive landing page.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>One Full Mini‑Project Every Month</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a 1–2 page website each month (portfolio section, product page, blog layout).</li>
            <li>Include: semantic HTML, Flexbox/Grid, responsive design, and a simple navigation.</li>
            <li>Tools: GitHub for version control, VS Code, HTML and CSS Validator.</li>
            <li>Checkpoint: Share the project with a classmate or instructor for feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Learn Real Workplace Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow a Git workflow: branch → commit → pull request.</li>
            <li>Read one article per week on best practices (BEM, accessibility, naming conventions).</li>
            <li>Tools: GitHub, CSS Tricks, Smashing Magazine.</li>
            <li>Checkpoint: After 3 weeks, review what practices I’ve adopted and what still feels unclear.</li>
        </ul>
